# octopus-crapshoot
**Authors:** David Kurilla, Dahlia Adams, Muhammad Shahid


This program runs a browser-based game of crapshoot: a game
where you bet everything you've earned on one more throw of the dice.

The game simulates a pair of dice, giving the user a higher score 
the more the dice are rolled. But if the dice roll the number 7, the game
is lost and all the money earned along with it.
