  <h1 class="htph1">Welcome to Octopus Crapshoot</h1>

  <p>Octopus Crapshoot is an engaging dice-based gambling game that offers thrilling opportunities to test your luck and
    strategy.</p>
  <p>Prepare to embark on an exhilarating adventure as you roll a pair of dice and aim to achieve the optimal outcome.
  </p>
  <p>If your initial roll results in a total of 7 or 11, your luck runs dry, and you face the unfortunate consequence
    of losing the round.</p>

  <h3 class="htph3">However,</h3>
  <p>If your roll doesn't yield one of those unfavorable totals, rejoice! You earn a valuable <span class="warn">point.
  </span> Each successful roll adds to your tally, propelling you towards greater heights of achievement. The ultimate
    goal is to accumulate the highest score possible without succumbing to the risk of <span class="red">busting
      .</span></p>
  <p>Should you desire to intensify the thrill and potentially reap greater rewards, you have the option to
    <span class="warn">double down.</span> By doing so, the points you gain match the total of your roll! However,
    be aware that this decision also amplifies the perils. Doubling down exposes you to the risk of busting not only
    with a 7 or 11, but also with a 2 or a 12.</p>
