  <h1>How to Play:</h1>

  <p>Octopus Crapshoot is a simple, dice-based gambling game. </p>
  <p>To begin, roll a pair of dice and add the two numbers together.</p>
  <p>If you rolled a total of a 7 or 11, sorry, you lose!</p>

  <h3>BUT</h3>
  <p>If you didn't roll one of those two totals, you gain a <span class="text-warning">point.</span>Each time you
  roll the dice without losing, you gain <span class="text-warning">more points</span>. The object of the game is to
    score as high as you possibly can without <span class="text-danger">busting</span>.
  </p>
  <p>If you want to risk more for a higher reward, you can <span class="text-warning">double down.</span> When you do, you gain
  points equal to whatever total you roll! <br>
    <span class="text-danger">BUT</span> <br>
    with higher points comes more danger. If you double down, <span class="text-warning">you will bust if you roll a 2 or a 12</span> as well
    as a 7 or 11.
